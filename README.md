<h2> BPvCPP </h2>
The goal of this project is for use to be able to analyze and profile the differences between Unreal Blueprints and C++ implementations. 
In the inital video we try to share the shock we received when running the first test to show proof of concept for what we were looking to achieve.
We want to present and perform the tests as fairly as possible and get as close as we can to 'comparing apples to apples', in order to preserve the integrity of the tests.

<h3>Goals:</h3>
1 - Provide a platform for those who are interested to reach their own conclusions about when / where to use Blueprints and when to use C++.<br>
2 - Learn and develop an understanding of the situations where it would more beneficial to use C++ or Blueprints.<br>
3 - Understand the best practices for coding and incorporating these principles during development.<br>
4 - Create tests to assess information / theories found on the internet and prove if it is true or not, in order to make more informed decisions.<br>

<h3>What we are not trying to do:</h3>
We are not trying to prove C++ is the superior format. While it is much faster in the tests we have performed, there are a great many benefits to using Blureprints.
UI for instance is a lot easier to build, setup and use within the blueprint environment. Other things such as: one-off tasks, templating, testing, protoyping, learning, and experimenting,
are all great uses for Blueprints. Indie games, feature samples and demo projects are also a great fit for blueprints as well.

This repo is going to be updated regularly while we are working through different tests and whenever we enounter various problems along the way. 
As a result, the code in the videos may be different from the code you see currently on the repo. However, we will try to be as accurate and concise with the commits as possible and provide
relevant information for major changes.
