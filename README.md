<h2> BPvCPP </h2>
The goal of this project is for use to be able to analyze and profile the differences between Unreal Blueprints and C++ implementations. 
In the inital video we try to share the shock we received when running the first test to show proof of conecpt for what we were looking to achieve.
We want to present and perform the tests in as unbiased a manner as possible and get as close as we can to comparing apples to apples to preserve the integrity of the tests.

<h3>Goals:</h3>
1- Provide everyone interested with a platform to come to their own conclusions about when and where to use Blueprints and when it is better to use C++.<br>
2- Learn and develop an understanding of when it is beneficial to use C++ and when the use Blueprints is beneficial.<br>
3- Understand better the best practices for coding and improve our code to be more efficient.<br>
4- Take the knowledge of the internet on things we dont understand, and prove if it is true or not, so we can truly understand for ourselves.<br>

<h3>What we are not trying to do:</h3>
We are not trying to prove C++ is the superior format. While it is much faster in the tests we have performed, there are a great many benefits to using Blureprints.
UI for instance is a lot easier to build, setup and use while within the blueprint environment. One off tasks. Templating, testing, protoyping, learning, and experimenting,
are all great uses for Blueprints. Indie games, feature samples,  and demo projects are a great fit for blueprints as well.



This repo is going to be updated regularly while we are working through different tests and enounter different problems along the way. 
So the code in the first video may be different than the code you see from the repo as download it for yourself. This is due to use changing and methods and trying to get more 
information out of the build than we were previously. We will try to be as accurate and concise with the commits and explain what we change but no guarantees.
